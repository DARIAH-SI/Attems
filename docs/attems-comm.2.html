The itinerary led him first to Würzburg and other German cities, then to Prague, the Dutch city of Leiden and France, and finally to Italy. The main objective of such journeys was to educate young noblemen and broaden their horizons, which was seen as a necessary task for the heir to a hereditary landed property and future active steward of the territorial estates. On his journey the young count learned about the culture, art, politics and society of each territory visited, and he wrote extensively about everything to his family back in Graz (thirty-four letters to his father have been located to date). After four years, in October 1738, Ignaz Maria, enriched by a bounty of new experiences, impressions and knowledge, finally returned to his native Styria. <span id="preinfalk-ftn1_return"><a class="notelink" title="His Grand Tour was first studied, from a musicological point of view, by Metoda Kokole in 2014.

Whereas some historians link the first Attems with the German Counts of Montfort, the family left its earliest, more tangible traces in the thirteenth century after it divided into the branches of Attems-Orso and Attems-Trident. An important place in Slovenian history was held by the latter, which produced family lines that lived and worked in the territory of the Habsburg Monarchy until the twentieth century, and have survived in Italy and Austria up to modern times. Their coat of arms features a three-point argent on a red escutcheon.</p><p id="attems2-p-98"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>The rise of the Attems family is closely related to the evolution of the County of Gorizia under Habsburg rule after 1500. The Attems started to forge a close affiliation with the Habsburg territories when, shortly before his death, the new territorial prince of Gorizia, Emperor Maximilian I, offered the post of court counsellor to Friedrich Attems (1447–1517), who had already held the high office of court chancellor under Leonard, the last Count of Gorizia. In the first half of the sixteenth century, the Attems still mostly lived in their Friuli and Gorizia estates, where they held important positions as chancellors, counsellors and territorial governors. The central Attems estate in Gorizia was Heiligenkreuz (in Slovenian, Sveti Križ, today Vipavski Križ) in the Vipava valley, which Friedrich’s great-grandson Hermann Attems (1564–1611) bought from the Counts of Thurn-Valsassina in 1605. That same year Hermann was promoted to the rank of baron and given the predicate of nobility Heiligenkreuz (twenty-five years later his widow Ursula and their children were further elevated to the rank of counts). This marked the establishment of the family line that still bears the official name of Attems- Heiligenkreuz and distinguishes itself from the other, likewise still existing, line of Attems-Petzenstein, whose origins date to the sixteenth century, when Hermann’s second uncle Andreas Attems (1527–1597) built a palace at Peci in Friuli (in Slovenian, Peč; in German, Petzenstein: today in Italy, close to Miren in Slovenia) on the Italian side of the present-day border. Archduke Karl granted that palace the right to asylum and bestowed upon Andreas Attems the predicate of Attems-Petzenstein. The castles that gave their names to the two distinct branches of the Attems family have both become ruins, whereas the Capuchin monastery that the Attems built in the 1630s still stands today in Vipavski Križ.</p><p id="attems2-p-99"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>In 1582 Friedrich’s grandson Jakob Adam Attems (1526–1590) moved to Graz at the behest of Archduke Karl, thereby introducing his successors to a new living environment—that of Styria. The family went on to flourish in this Habsburg territory under Jakob Adam’s great-grandson Ignaz Maria (1652–1732), who is considered the founder of the Styrian branch of the Attems family.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="attems-comm.2.3"><h3><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="attems2-head-53">Grandfather Ignaz Maria the Elder—“the establisher of material and family foundations”</span></h3><p id="attems2-p-100"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>Although he was born on 15 August 1652 in Ljubljana and had no early ties with Styria,<span id="preinfalk-ftn3_return"><a class="notelink" title="Based on document: NŠAL, ŽA Ljubljana-Sv.

After burying two wives who had given him five children, he married Marquise Franziska Strozzi, who bore him six more, including Ignaz Maria as the penultimate child. However, the happy family’s life would soon be shattered: at the age of eleven Ignaz Maria lost his father, and three years later his mother died as well. Whereas almost nothing is known about his early childhood, a few further, albeit not completely reliable, details have been preserved with regard to the boy’s education. He undoubtedly attended school in Graz, and probably before that also in Gorizia, whereas claims that he attended the high school in Ruše are probably erroneous or fabricated.<span id="preinfalk-ftn5_return"><a class="notelink" title="Barbara Murovec, “Historizirana podoba naročnika: Attemsova družinska portreta in Rembov avtoportret iz brežiškega gradu”, Acta historiae artis Sloven…" href="#preinfalk-ftn5"><sup>5</sup></a></span> There is likewise no doubt regarding his ‘gentleman’s journey’ through Italy, and some indirect indications further suggest that Ignaz Maria may have also travelled to other lands (e.g. France). On returning from his journey, he made a short stop in Ljubljana and ultimately settled down in Styria after being named a councillor of the Inner Austrian Court Chamber in Graz. <span id="preinfalk-ftn6_return"><a class="notelink" title="Murovec, “Historizirana podoba naročnika”, 117–120." href="#preinfalk-ftn6"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p><p id="attems2-p-101"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>While his elder brother Johann Franz Anton continued the so-called Heiligenkreuz branch of the Attems family, Ignaz Maria founded a new family branch that was later named after Slovenska Bistrica, one of his numerous estates. Well-known for his prudent investment in landed property and its diligent management, Ignaz Maria became one of the wealthiest noblemen in Styria. Thus at the end of the seventeenth century and during the first decades of the eighteenth century (leaving aside his main residence, the palace in Graz), his estates comprised the seigniories (demesnes) and castles of Štatenberg (Stattenberg), Podčetrtek (Windisch Landsberg), Slovenska Bistrica (Windisch Feistriz), Hartenštajn (Hartenstein), Pilštanj (Peilenstein) and Brežice (Rann), plus Rajhenburg (Reichenburg), which he merged with Turn below the castle; all these estates lie today in Slovenia. Ignaz Maria also bought the seigniory of Gösting near Graz with its office in Aigen. By hiring distinguished architects and painters, Ignaz Maria converted his buildings into architectural artworks (one of his most magnificent commissions was the painting of the Knights’ Hall in Brežice Castle). His commissions set a trend and standard for Baroque-style building in Styria. <span id="preinfalk-ftn7_return"><a class="notelink" title="On Ignaz Maria Attems’ commissions and creation of a family empire, see especially Murovec, “Historizirana podoba naročnika”, 113–131; and Dejan Zadra…" href="#preinfalk-ftn7"><sup>7</sup></a></span></p><p id="attems2-p-102"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Ignaz Maria was married twice; first in 1685 to Countess Maria Regina Wurmbrand-Stuppach,<span id="preinfalk-ftn8_return"><a class="notelink" title="Based on document: DGS, Pfarre Graz—Hl.

Only the two eldest sons created their own families, with material foundations provided by their father Ignaz Maria, who had to this end formed two family trusts out of his vast estate. The eldest son, Franz Dismas, obtained an inheritance comprising the family palace in Graz as well as the seignories of Brežice, Gösting, Slovenska Bistrica, and Štatenberg. His younger brother, Thaddäus Kajetan, inherited Podčetrtek, Hartenštajn, and Rajhenburg from his father and later also came into the possession of other landed properties, including Dornava, which his brother Franz Dismas purchased for him. <span id="preinfalk-ftn10_return"><a class="notelink" title="Zadravec, “Postavitev in postavljalec”, 111.

A few years later he was promoted to the position of vice-president of the Styrian territorial estates, and he was part of the delegation that in 1728 welcomed the imperial family—more specifically, in July of that year Emperor Karl VI received in Graz the hereditary homage of the Styrian territorial estates.</p><p id="attems2-p-106"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>After his father’s death in 1732 Franz Dismas inherited vast estates and proved himself to be a good administrator.

That same year he was made a privy counsellor to the emperor and vice-president of the Inner Austrian Court Chamber; two years later he assumed its presidency. After he had held this office for over a decade, the Court Chamber was abolished in 1748 as part of the Theresian reforms. In March 1750 Empress Maria Theresa chose Franz Dismas in compensation to become president of the highest Inner Austrian auditing body (its Court). However, his tenure was brief, since he died that same year. <span id="preinfalk-ftn16_return"><a class="notelink" title="Based on document: DGS, Pfarre Graz—Hl.

He removed the seigniory of Gösting and its office in Aigen from his father’s trust and converted them into allodial (freehold) estates, which he then left to his son Franz Anton (1729–1788), whom he also named as his principal heir in his last will and testiment (1749). The so-called Gösting family branch of the Attems family continued in existence right up to the twentieth century. Franz Dismas’ eldest son from his second marriage, named Dismas for short (1718–1765), established a family as well and took over Štatenberg after his father’s death in 1750. However, having produced seven daughters and no sons, his family branch died out already in the next generation.</p><p id="attems2-p-110"><span class="numberParagraph">6</span>Three of Franz Dismas’ sons devoted their lives to the Church: particularly the two who suffered from deafness and speech impediments, conditions that prevented them from living a normal life. Sigmund (1720–1754) joined the Cistercian Order in Rein, while the younger son, Friedrich (1739–1818), joined the Augustinian Order in Vorau. Although a third brother, Josef (1734–1820), was born without any physical or mental disability, he too embarked on an ecclesiastical career at the request of his old uncle (or, rather, his grandfather’s brother), Ernst Gottlieb, bishop of Ljubljana, who smoothed the boy’s way up the ecclesiastical ladder. Josef accordingly became a canon at Olomouc Cathedral at the age of fifteen. A few years later he was also given a canonry in Salzburg, which his aged uncle renounced in his favour. One year after Ernst’s death Josef was admitted in addition to the cathedral chapter in Passau, thereby becoming at the young age of twenty-four a canon in three of the most important cathedral chapters of the Empire. In 1777 the archbishop of Salzburg, Hieronymus Colloredo, appointed him president of the Court Council. The final years of Josef’s life were disturbed by the tumultuous Napoleonic Wars. Salzburg initially became a secular princedom in 1803; a few years later it fell under Austrian rule, then Bavarian rule, and finally Austrian rule again. During that period Josef Attems resided variously in Salzburg and Passau, but once a peace treaty had been concluded he remained in Salzburg, where he died at a very old age in 1820.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="attems-comm.2.5"><h3><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="attems2-head-55">Ignaz Maria the Younger—a ‘travelling gentleman’</span></h3><p id="attems2-p-111"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>On his death in 1750 Franz Dismas, at that time the head of the Slovenska Bistrica branch of the Attems family, was succeeded by his eldest son Ignaz Maria (1714–1762),<span id="preinfalk-ftn21_return"><a class="notelink" title="On Ignaz Maria the Younger, see: Attems-Pallavicino, Familiengeschichte, VI/3." href="#preinfalk-ftn21"><sup>21</sup></a></span> born on 27 February 1714 in the Attems palace located in the Sackstrasse in Graz.

Since he lost his mother at a very tender age and his father did not remarry quickly, Ignaz Leander was placed in foster care, as was customary during that period. His foster mother was a commoner named Anna Maria Popp. It was only after his father married again and gave him a stepmother that the boy was taken from his foster home and returned to his family.</p><p id="attems2-p-112"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>After his father’s death Ignaz Maria inherited most of his property, and even before that he had come into possession of Vurberk via Christiana Herberstein, the second wife of his grandfather—or, rather, his father’s stepmother (and mother-in-law). At the age of twenty he set out on a four-year-long ‘gentleman’s journey’ across Europe (Bohemia, German states, the Netherlands and Italy). <span id="preinfalk-ftn23_return"><a class="notelink" title="Kokole, “Glasbeni utrinki”, 57–79." href="#preinfalk-ftn23"><sup>23</sup></a></span> On his return he immediately offered his services to his native Styria and was appointed as a councillor of the Inner Austrian government in Graz. He also held the offices of chamberlain and a privy counsellor at the court of Charles VI, and later that of his daughter Maria Theresa. Apart from being renowned as an excellent horse rider, Ignaz Maria was also a passionate hunter. Therefore, it is not surprising that in Slovenska Bistrica, where he also renovated the local castle, he ran a riding school founded by his father. Following his father’s death Ignaz Maria also established a stud farm at Brežice, which around 1760 boasted 160 mares and foals. Though famous far and wide, this stud farm was an extremely expensive enterprise.</p><p id="attems2-p-113"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Before long Ignaz Maria also ensured the continuation of his lineage. On returning from his ‘gentleman’s journey’, he met his future wife: a noblewoman from the Tyrol, Josefa Countess Khuen-Belasi, who reportedly distinguished herself “more for her sparkle and authenticity than her beauty.” At the end of October 1739 Ignaz Maria led her to the altar in the castle chapel of the Liechtenstein Castle in Guntramsdorf near Vienna.<span id="preinfalk-ftn24_return"><a class="notelink" title="The castle is no longer there; after the Second World War a garrison of Soviet soldiers did so much damage to it that it was razed to the ground in 19…" href="#preinfalk-ftn24"><sup>24</sup></a></span> The wedding ceremony was conducted by Ignaz Maria’s uncle Ernst Gottlieb Attems, then still the Bishop of Dragovitia (Thrace).

He died in 1762, still relatively young, at the age of forty-eight. Having suffered from illness since early childhood, he often donated generous sums of money to honour the Madonna, including that of Vurberk, as his protectress against hardships. During the 1760s his health rapidly plummeted after he contracted pneumonia, which developed into pulmonary edema. In the spring of 1762 Ignaz Maria travelled for medical consultations to Vienna, from where he never returned. He died at 8 p.m. on 15 June “am hohen Markt im Albrechtsburgischen Haus” and found his final resting place in the crypt of the Church of Our Dear Lady of the Scots in Vienna. <span id="preinfalk-ftn26_return"><a class="notelink" title="Based on document: EW, Pfarre Wien—St. Stephan, SB 1761–1764, fol. 92." href="#preinfalk-ftn26"><sup>26</sup></a></span></p><p id="attems2-p-115"><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>In his last will Ignaz Maria named his eldest son Ferdinand as his principal heir, while apportioning the residue of his estate among his other children and instructing his wife to provide them all with education befitting their rank.

Empress Maria Theresa, to whom Josefa was very close, offered help and invited several of her children to the imperial court.

After witnessing both the dissolution and reestablishment of the Institution of Noble Ladies, she became its first grand dean at the end of 1816 and died soon afterwards, in the early part of 1818. The youngest of the daughters, Theresia (1748–1804), was admitted to an institution of noble ladies as well, but one further away from home, since Empress Maria Theresa secured her a place in the secular Institution of Noble Ladies at Sainte Waudru in the Southern Netherlandish city of Mons. She, too, was caught up in a turbulent turn of events that were sparked by the French Revolution and which forced the noble ladies to leave the institution in Mons. Because the war prevented Theresia from returning to her native Styria, a noble lady from the d’Argentau family came to her aid and provided her with shelter in nearby Ochain Castle, which belonged to her family. Theresia spent more than a decade there before dying in September 1804.</p><p id="attems2-p-118"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Of Ignaz Maria the Younger’s sons, Ferdinand, as the eldest, inherited the family property and remained in Styria, whereas all the other sons devoted themselves to military careers or the priesthood, dispersing all over the globe; Alois (1751–1753) died in childhood. The first to embark on a military career was the second-born, Ernst, who was promoted to the rank of colonel and lost his life in 1796 in a battle against the French army at Lodi, Italy. His younger brother Ignaz (1750–1802), who had nurtured a passion for weapons since boyhood, enlisted in the army at the age of nineteen. A few years later he also became a member of the Teutonic Order, in which he served as a commander in Metlika and Črnomelj, and subsequently in Velika Nedelja, all of these localities lying within the territory of present-day Slovenia. He particularly distinguished himself in the war against the Turks in Hungary but was ultimately compelled to leave the army due to failing health. Ignaz died at a relatively young age in 1802.</p><p id="attems2-p-119"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>A similar fate could have been in store for the youngest of the children, Leopold (1758–1815), who donned a military uniform at a young age and was initially expected to join the Teutonic Order but ultimately decided against doing so. As an officer, he took part in Emperor Joseph II’s military campaigns and served later in the war against the French, for which he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. During his service in Hungary he met the almost three decades younger Countess Maria Anna Gavre (1785–1856) from Flanders and married her in 1803 despite their difference in age. In the following twelve years the couple produced six children—the last born after Leopold’s death—all of whom died very young. When, in 1809, a new war broke out with France, Leopold came out of retirement to take part in the battles in Tyrol, obtaining in 1811 the rank of general <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">ad honores.</span> He died from ill-health in early 1815.</p><p id="attems2-p-120"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>The fourth brother, Franz (1754–after 1820), became a soldier and just like Ignaz took part in the war against the Turks in Hungary and Croatia.

Franz left the army and married his cousin’s widow Josefa (née Countess Sándor; 1758–1803), who already had a daughter, Esther, and a son, Anton. To Franz Attems she bore two more children: a daughter, Juliana, and a son, Anton. Both children died young, condemning this branch of the Attems family to early extinction. In 1814 Franz successfully married his stepdaughter Esther, who inherited from her father vast estates in Bohemia and Hungary, to his nephew Franz Attems (1783–1847).</p><p id="attems2-p-121"><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>While four sons of Ignaz Maria the Younger devoted themselves to military careers, the second-youngest, Hermann (1756–1809), joined the clergy.

On returning to Styria, he immediately offered his services to his homeland and became a member of the Styrian territorial estates.

Despite his endeavours to attain the greatest possible independence from the central government in Vienna, when, in 1793, war broke out with France, Ferdinand unhesitatingly promised the young Emperor Franz II 100,000 guldens of assistance from Styria.

As a district commissary he served in Maribor, Bruck an der Mur and Celje, ending his career as a government adviser in Linz. After his father’s death in 1861 he returned to Graz and took charge of the family inheritance. His marriage to Countess Gabriela Wurmbrand-Stuppach brought him children, as well as the castle and estate of Gornja Radgona. He died in 1878 in Graz. <span id="preinfalk-ftn42_return"><a class="notelink" title="Based on document: DGS, Pfarre Graz—Hl.

Ignaz married his relative Countess Rosa Attems from Gösting and spent much time with her in Slovenska Bistrica. After their marriage remained childless Rosa started to exhibit increasingly strange behaviour. She refused to let anyone near her except her husband and maid. She slept throughout the day and became active only during the evening hours. After Ignaz’s death in early 1915 the family property passed down to his younger brother Edmund (1847–1929) in accordance with the principle of primogeniture.</p><p id="attems2-p-131"><span class="numberParagraph">6</span>Unlike Ignaz, Edmund took greatly after their father and even more after their uncle Ferdinand.<span id="preinfalk-ftn44_return"><a class="notelink" title="On Edmund, see: Attems-Pallavicino, Familiengeschichte, VI/6; Frank and Šerbelj, “Kratka zgodovina”, 155–156." href="#preinfalk-ftn44"><sup>44</sup></a></span> Although he initially studied agriculture and forestry in Graz, his path eventually led him to administration, in which he forged an illustrious career. Following the example of his predecessors, he was, among other things, also a long-standing Styrian territorial governor, the last such before the disintegration of the Habsburg Monarchy. In the territorial realm he was the most meritorious for the construction of hospitals, e.g. in Graz, Mürzzuschlag, and Rottenmann. Edmund was known for his modest, even Spartan, lifestyle, which many likened to that of Emperor Franz Joseph. A man of many obligations, he remained a bachelor and devoted his time to his nephews, the children of his younger brother Emilian.</p><p id="attems2-p-132"><span class="numberParagraph">7</span>As the second-born, Edmund initially had little say in administering the family estate, even though his elder brother’s childless marriage clearly meant that the property would one day pass down to him. On the other hand, he came to inherit Gornja Radgona after his mother’s death as well as the Inzaghi trust property of Ober-Kindberg near Bruck an der Mur (in secundogeniture) after the death of his uncle Friedrich Attems in 1901. However, the place he held closest to his heart was the seat of the family estate—Slovenska Bistrica, where he would spend most of his spare time. Notwithstanding this, he refused ever to go back to it after 1918, when this part of Styria fell under Yugoslav rule. A catalyst for this decision was his strained relations with the Slovenes, which dated from a time when he served as the Styrian territorial governor and, for example, opposed the establishment of a Slovenian lower gymnasium in Celje, which, as he maintained, would be detrimental to the interests of the German majority. Because of his attitude, the Slovenes continued to obstruct the operations of the territorial government for a long time afterwards. <span id="preinfalk-ftn45_return"><a class="notelink" title="See also: Cvirn, Boj za Celje, 53–55." href="#preinfalk-ftn45"><sup>45</sup></a></span></p><p id="attems2-p-133"><span class="numberParagraph">8</span>After the First World War Edmund came to terms with the republican reorganization of ‘German’ Austria and did not reminisce about the old days with nostalgia.

He died in May 1929 in a spa resort at Bad Hofgastein.</p><p id="attems2-p-134"><span class="numberParagraph">9</span>Since, as already stated, both Edmund and his elder brother Ignaz remained childless, the family property passed down to the sons of their younger brother Emilian (1857–1921): Emilian’s eldest son Ferdinand (1885–1946) took over the central estate he obtained in primogeniture along with Slovenska Bistrica, Podčetrtek, Brežice, Olimje, and the palace in Graz, while his younger brother Edmund (1891–1972) received in secundogeniture the Inzaghi estate in Ober-Kindberg. <span id="preinfalk-ftn46_return"><a class="notelink" title="On Emilian, see: Attems-Pallavicino, Familiengeschichte, VI/7." href="#preinfalk-ftn46"><sup>46</sup></a></span></p><p id="attems2-p-135"><span class="numberParagraph">10</span>The last lord of Slovenska Bistrica was therefore Ferdinand Attems, who assumed Yugoslav citizenship after the First World War and maintained regular contact with the Yugoslav royal family. During the Second World War he was drafted into the German Army. Sitting on the recruiting board, he helped many Slovenian conscripts, which ultimately cost him his position. Nevertheless, immediately after the war he and his wife, as well as their two sons, were arrested, found guilty of high treason and sentenced to forced labour, expulsion from Yugoslavia, and the confiscation of all their property. Ferdinand and his wife were detained for a while in the penal camp of Brestrenica, from where all trace was lost of them in early 1946.
